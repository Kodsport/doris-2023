\problemname{Who wins?}
\noindent
Johan and Abdullah are playing tic-tac-toe, but they are having a hard time figuring out who won.
To win in tic-tac-toe you need to have three of your letter in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Johan uses the letter \texttt{X} and makes the first move, and Abdullah uses the letter \texttt{O}. Help them figure out who has won, if anyone.

\section*{Input}
\noindent

\noindent
Input consists of a valid tic-tac-toe position, where an underscore \texttt{\_} represents an empty square, and the letters \texttt{X} and \texttt{O} represent Johan's and Abdullah's moves.
The position is described by three rows, each containing three space-separated characters each. It is guaranteed that at most one player has won.

\section*{Output}
\noindent
Print the winner of the game.
\noindent
First print the name, ``\texttt{Johan}'', ``\texttt{Abdullah}'' or ``\texttt{ingen}'', then ``\texttt{har vunnit}''.
\section*{Grading}
\noindent
Your solution will be tested on a number of test-case groups.
\noindent
To receive points for a group, your solution must correctly solve every test-case in the group.
